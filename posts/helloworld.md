# Hello World!
This is my first 'blog' post, I hope to use this blog more often and will continue to perfect this website over the coming days.

## This Website
This website has been a great way for me to learn new technologies! I'll try and break down some of my overarching experiences with some of the technologies in later posts once i've become a little bit more accustomed to this whole blogging thing, but for now i'll give a taste of my experiences with each of them.

## Typescript
Typescript has overall been a very enjoyable experience, the type safety has been preached far and wide on the webs and I can see why, it makes it very hard to write broken code lol.

## Next.js
Next.js has certainly been the largest mindset adjustment i've had to make for this website with how it routes throught its folders, using the new App Router feature has overall been very enjoyable as it's very intuitive *most* of the time.

## React
React has been fairly straight forward with what i've come to expect from web development. My tiny bit of experience I already have with the react DOM has been enough for me to use React to what I feel is a fluid degree. My experience with the python frameworks, namely Django, Flask and Jinja make me feel right at home with react and its syntactic sugars. The ability to directly put javascript (or typescript in this case) templating into the HTML elements was one of my favourite features of Jinja and i'm glad that React stays true to it within its JSX/TSX files.

## CSS
CSS will always be a nightmare for me lol. I tried to use the bootstrap library in the early stages of this website but i ultimately chose to forgo the traditional portfolio design and opted instead for a terminal ui, which definitely makes it harder for the average person to use my website but will hopefully be unique enough in the eyes of recruiters or computer savants that it sets me above the rest of the market. I started this project with expandability in mind and as such i've kept the bootstrap and tailwind remnants in the project and will hopefully get to use them in the near future.

## Prospects
Right now the website feels very baron as i've only just gotten the "front-page" terminal to a point that i'm happy with and i've started the early stage development of this blog. In the planning for this website I envisioned more of the typical "front-end" show-offy websites with nice and flashy CSS or something like rust with WGPU for client-side rendering or something like [neal.fun](https://neal.fun) that would
